.SH NAME
db2rkg â€” get ghost links from database urls
.SH SYNOPSIS
db2rkg \fB[\fR\fIfile\fR|\fIurl \fR.\|.\|.\fB]\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBdb2rkg\fR(1) utility takes either a \fIURL\fR or \fIfile\fR of URLs as arguments, or alternatively
reads URLs from standard input. These URLs must be urls to ghost pages on various Mario Kart Wii
ghost databases. After reading the urls, \fBdb2rkg\fR(1) will as the name implies, give you a link to
the RKG file directly. This new URL can then be passed to a utility such as \fBcurl\fR(1) to download
the ghost file(s).
.PP
The following ghost databases are supported:
